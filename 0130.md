p321-p331 Linearizability

in distributed system, we need to handle different unreliable faults, so that the system can be fault-tolerant.

we would like abstractions with useful guarantees: consensus.

later in this chapter, we will go deeper into the topic of consensus. For now, let's look at linearizablity and consistency guarantees.

# Linearizability
we have seen `eventual consistency` in single-leader replication. it does not hide the problem of replication lag, and is hard to use for application developers. it's too weak.

a stronger consistency model: linearizable  

a cluster with linearizable guarantee behaves like a single node. every operation on it takes effect just like at some point of time (between the start and the end of the operation).

## vs. Serializablity
Serializablity is about concurrent transactions execution. 

A database may provide both serializability and linearizability, and this combination
is known as strict serializability

> Implementations of serializability based on two-phase locking or actual serial execution are typically linearizable.

# Relying on Linearizability
why is Linearizability useful?  

## Locking and leader election
leader election --> acquiring a 'leader' lock --> We want to have a fault-tolerant and linearizable distributed lock service.

Coordination services like `Apache ZooKeeper` and `etcd` are often used to implement distributed locks and leader election.

## Constraints and uniqueness guarantees
username registeration: use a 'single-node'-like linearizable cluster to determine who wins.

## Cross-channel timing dependencies
ToDo
